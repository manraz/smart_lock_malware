This code can grab a desktop screenshot when user is logged into Google Password manager web app. The screenshot will be taken at any keyboard event and send over as email. The code needs to be converted to  Windows executable using pyinstaller. Once it runs on system it will have persistence, so you will have to delete the new registry key it creates at following path: 'Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run'
